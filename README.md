# mp3Player

Built a user interface for the MP3 Blast Box application using javafx, At application startup, the list of available tracks is populated from a “music” directory adjacent to where the application is located. This directory only has music files in .mp3 format. When the “Add” button is clicked, a track selected in the available list is added to the selected tracks list. The button is not enabled unless a track is selected in the available list.
Also, the application implements removal of a single track and removal of all tracks from the selected tracks list.
When the “Play” button is clicked, the highlighted track from the list of selected tracks is played, in addition the stop button will stop the music while the Pause button will pause the music.
There is a slider to control volume.
Finally, there is a play position feedback which is implemnted using a slider.
